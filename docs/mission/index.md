# Coral Credits Mission

Coral Credits aims to support the building of a "coral reef style" fixed capacity cloud.
A Coral reef style cloud involves cooperatively sharing resources
to maximise your investiment in both people and cloud resources.

Coral credits are focused on how to support sharing of resources
using multiple interfaces such as:
Azimuth, OpenStack Blazar and Slurm

## User Experience

### Project and User onboarding

We are assuming resources are trying to follow the AARC blueprint,
such that groups are managed via a central AAAI proxy, typically
based on Idigo IAM or Keycloak:
